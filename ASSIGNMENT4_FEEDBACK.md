Hi Jenny!

Great choice for this assignment, and you've done a great job.

I've left a few comments in the js and html files, but they are suggestions more than anything. The only ma`jor thing you missed was appending something to the API url - see below - but you did everything else required so well that I'm happy to say your earned a VG!

Well done! You don't have to fix anything, but if you would like to for your own learning I'll be happy to take another look.
